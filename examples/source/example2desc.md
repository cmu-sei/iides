# United States of America v. Emily Cabello

In the case United States of America v. Emily Cabello, with case number 1:03-cr-012, the United States Government brought charges against Emily Cabello. The case was heard in the Southern District Court of Texas, a federal court located in Texas. Emily Cabello was charged under 18 U.S.C Section 793(e) for the willful retention and transmission of national defense information. She was indicted on one count, to which she pleaded guilty as part of a plea bargain, resulting in her conviction.

The incident was first detected on April 23, 2003, by law enforcement through automated checks and email monitoring. Emily Cabello was identified as the culprit after investigators discovered that a classified document published by The Journal had been printed with traceable metadata. Printer tracking dots were used to determine the document's print date, and access logs were reviewed, revealing that only six individuals, including Cabello, had accessed it. Additional evidence was found in her email communications with The Journal, and she confessed when confronted by the FBI.

The impact of the incident was significant, with high and low metrics both rated at 1. The incident, occurring in May 2003, involved Emily Cabello, an ex-Navy member, who worked as a cybersecurity specialist for the National Cybersecurity Agency (NCA). During her tenure, she printed a report detailing unauthorized access attempts by a foreign hacking group against municipal election systems and voter databases. She shared this Top Secret information with a tech blog. The report revealed the techniques and tools used to gather the information, which, if disclosed, could be detrimental to the United States. The FBI investigated and arrested Cabello in June 2003. She pleaded guilty in June 2004 to one felony count of unauthorized transmission of national defense information and was subsequently convicted.

Emily Cabello, also known by aliases Sara Cabello and Jane Doe, resided in Houston, Texas. She was a 25-year-old female, a US citizen, and had a bachelor's degree. At the time of the incident, she was single with no children. Cabello had a clean record and was considered an unlikely suspect, described as a 'model employee' with no apparent history of misconduct or disciplinary proceedings during her military service in the Navy.

Cabello worked as a cybersecurity specialist for the National Cybersecurity Agency (NCA), a critical player in the U.S. intelligence community based in Virginia. The NCA's primary function is to protect national security by preventing cyber threats. She was employed as a contractor with an access authorization level of 4. Her hire date was February 1, 2003, and she departed on July 1, 2003, with a tenure of 2904 hours.

The legal response to Cabello's actions was swift. Law enforcement was contacted on May 1, 2003, and she was arrested two days later on May 3. She was charged on May 7 and pleaded guilty on May 21. The judgment was passed on August 7, 2004, and she was sentenced on August 23, 2004.

Emily Cabello's case was documented in various sources, including fabricated documents such as "United States v. Cabello" dated April 24, 2005, a case study on unlawful retention and transmission of national defense information, and court documents like USA v. Emily Marie Cabello, No. 03-11692 (11th Cir. 2005).
