# United States v. Xin Xia

In the early 2000s, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York handled the case of United States v. Xin Xia (Case Number 1:03-cr-154). Xin Xia, a former security officer, was charged under 18 U.S.C. Section 794(c) for conspiracy to gather or deliver defense information to aid a foreign government, under 18 U.S.C. Section 794(a) for the delivery of defense information to aid a foreign government, and for attempted delivery of defense information to aid a foreign government. Additionally, Xia was charged under 18 U.S.C. Section 1001(a)(2) for making material false statements. The insider, motivated by financial gain, began communicating with foreign intelligence agents in 2002, exchanging classified U.S. defense information for money. The insider initially contacted an acquaintance in a government security agency, indicating they had been approached by foreign intelligence agents. During an interview with CIA and FBI agents, Xia was visibly surprised when secure chat messages showing their espionage appeared on the screen, prompting a thorough investigation by the FBI.

The FBI's investigation, which began in January 2003, uncovered evidence of espionage in Xia's home. The legal response included contacting law enforcement on February 12, 2003, arresting Xia on March 22, 2003, charging them on April 27, 2003, and obtaining a guilty plea on May 28, 2003. The judgment was rendered on June 8, 2004, and Xia was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison on May 17, 2005. The case highlighted the insider's predispositions and concerning behaviors, including financial struggles, as Xia was behind on two mortgage payments and had significant debt.

Xia, a 60-year-old male from New York, NY, had a long tenure as a case officer/contractor from January 1992 to January 2002, followed by a position as a consultant from January 2002 to July 2003. The organizations involved were the U.S. Security Agency, focused on national security, and the Foreign Intelligence Agency, a foreign entity focused on intelligence and national security. The insider communicated repeatedly with foreign intelligence officers, exchanging top-secret information for money, and was initially recruited by a foreign intelligence agent through LinkedIn.

The sources documenting this case include a news article titled "Former Security Officer Sentenced to 20 Years After Spying for Foreign Government" dated May 17, 2005, and various legal documents and court cases from 2003 to 2006. The incident was significant, with high impacts estimated between 3 and 12 on a scale, leading to severe consequences for national security. The case of Xin Xia underscores the critical importance of robust security measures and vigilant monitoring to protect classified information from insider threats.
