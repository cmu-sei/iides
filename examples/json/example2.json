During this time, she printed a report from her work computer that detailed unauthorized access attempts by a foreign hacking group against municipal election systems and voter databases.

This report revealed the techniques and tools used to gather the information contained in the report, which, if disclosed, could be detrimental to the United States. A government agency investigated her and the insider pleaded guilty in June 2004 to one felony count of unauthorized transmission of national defense information and was convicted.",
