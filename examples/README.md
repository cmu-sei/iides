## Example 2

**Case**: USA vs. Caballo

**Description**: The insider, a former military member, worked as a cybersecurity specialist for a government agency in May 2003. During this time, she printed a report from her work computer that detailed unauthorized access attempts by a foreign hacking group against municipal election systems and voter databases. She then shared this Top Secret information with a tech blog. This report revealed the techniques and tools used to gather the information contained in the report, which, if disclosed, could be detrimental to the United States. A government agency investigated her and the insider pleaded guilty in June 2004 to one felony count of unauthorized transmission of national defense information and was convicted.
