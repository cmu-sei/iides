# Workflow and Editing

The json files are the only files that should be edited. The UML and markdown documentation are autogenerated off of the json files using the `generate_*.py` scripts.

To update the schema,

1. Edit the json file(s)
2. Validate the formatting and test the edits using a json validator
3. Run generate_docs.py to update the markdown documentation files
4. Run generate_schema_doc.py to update the full schema file
5. (optional) Run generate_erd.py to update the ERD files (only necessary if classes or field names have been updated)
6. (if ERDs changed) Use PlantUML's export function to export a png file from the UML/source to UML/out.
