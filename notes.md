# Austin's Random Notes during dev

## Questions/Concerns
- How to handle location of incident?
    - is incident location always the same as the insider and/or organization location?
    - Should incident have its own location?
        - Right now, it does
- Do we need the specific lists of substances and psychological issues?
- Is it important that we retain the numbering on the observables?

## TO DO
