# Austin's Random Notes during dev

## Questions/Concerns
- How to handle location of incident?
    - is incident location always the same as the insider and/or organization location?
    - Should incident have its own location?
        - Right now, it does
- Do we need the specific lists of substances and psychological issues?
- Is it important that we retain the numbering on the observables?
- org-relationship vs orgRole: the vocabulatries are identical
- how well are workplace violence and suicidal ideation handeled by this schema?

## TO DO
- change attack TTP to TTP or action?
- add "format" to doc generator (ex. date, datetime)
- add "dependentRequired" to doc generator
- handle relationships in the json schema
