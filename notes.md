# Austin's Random Notes during dev

## Questions/Concerns

### Others
- Target:
  - People vs money: we're defining money to include things are converted (ex. time sheets) make sense?
  - category/subcategory should be reorganized a bit
  - Leverage Cyber DEM for this?
- Job:
 - some of the employment types don't make sense now that Job is its own entity
- Do we need the specific lists of substances and psychological issues?
- org-relationship vs orgRole: the vocabulatries are identical
- iron out the zero, one, or more relationships in the erd

## TODO
- handle relationships in the json schema
  - define owner relationship
- go back through codebook and list missing/skipped fields

- Write up intro material for white paper
- Note handling of inexact dates
