![IIDES Core Diagram](UML/out/IIDES_Core.png "IIDES Core")

## Workflow and Editing

The json files are the only files that should be edited. The UML and markdown documentation are autogenerated off of the json files using the `generate_*.py` scripts.

To update the schema, 
1. Edit the json file(s)
2. Validate the formatting and test the edits using a json validator
3. Run generate_docs.py and generate_erd.py
4. Use PlantUML's export function to export a png file from the UML/source to UML/out.
