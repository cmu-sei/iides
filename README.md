# IIDES Repository

The Insider Incident Data Exchange Standard (IIDES) is a new standard for the collection and sharing of insider threat incidents. IIDES is intented to support a community of practioners, analysts, and researchers in their efforts to reduce threats from insiders across organizations of all sizes and in all sectors. View the [IIDES White Paper](documentation/WhitePaper.md) for a deeper understanding of the goals of IIDES and the guiding principles for its development.

The schema itself is written in JSON. All of the IIDES schema components can be found in the [json](json/) folder. The schema files have also been combined into one complete schema file, [iides_full_schema.json](iides_full_schema.json), for direct use in IIDES implementations.

Easy to read documentation for each component of the schema can be found in the [documentation folder](documentation/) of this repository. The complete [entity diagram](UML/out/IIDES.png) and the [entity relationship diagram](UML/out/IIDES_Entity_Relationships.png) may also be useful.

We also have a set of [IIDES examples](examples/README.md) to help provide an understanding of how IIDES can be used.

We encourage feedback from our user community and welcome requests for improvements to IIDES, which can be submitted through GitHub.
